Let’s collaborate to make the world a more delicious place.


### Hospitality Consultation
I received three stars from the Chicago Tribune for my menu development and implementation in residency at Intro Restaurant. I’ve developed menus for galas at The New Museum, advised Sam Adams Beer on flavor development, and executed private events for partners including Google, Stella Artois, Conde Nast, L’Oreal, and Land Rover. I’m also a founding partner with Meltyman Grilled Cheese in Japan.

Contact me if you'd like to hear my thoughts on a hospitality project; CPG brand; event, festival, or pop-up.


### Home Consultation
Cooking and dining spaces invariably become focal points of any home. Contact me if you’d like help outfitting your home for relaxed, elegant, and professional cooking, eating, and entertaining. Based on your needs and space, I will recommend essential tools, small appliances, cutlery, tableware, and more. I can also provide simple lessons


### Education
Food and flavor are great lenses through which to examine political, economic, social, environmental, and physical well-being. I love showing young people, in or out of school, how cooking truly develops self confidence, self-expression, and civic engagement., and become engaged citizens. In Brooklyn, I ran a free after-school program for middle-schoolers, using my Pith venue to teach them about Economic, Artistic, and Social empowerment.

I’ve spoken at Georgetown University, Stanford University, Columbia University, and at conferences in Abu Dhabi, Kuala Lumpur, and more.

Contact me for assistance designing, implementing, and evaluating culinary arts education and food service standards.


### Tours
For select individuals or groups, I enjoy crafting bespoke tours select groups to the best farmer’s markets, hidden eating . Tours will be individually tailored to a groups’ interest, and can include a cooking class or demonstration if desired.


### Art
Eating provides the perfect sensory background to experientially appreciate art. I serve my food on tableware made exclusively by my mother and the artist Lily Fein. I enjoy integrating visual artwork from friends into my hosting spaces. My partner Sarah Bruckner and I carefully designed our home with an eye towards seamless hosting.

Please reach out if you are interested in me curating or developing a gallery dinner, an edible collaboration with an artist, or something entirely surprising.


### Cannabis
Cannabis can elevate a dining experience when integrated gently and artfully. I am the founder of Alto, a brand of essentials infused with THC and CBD which I hope will change the landscape of edible cannabinoid products.
