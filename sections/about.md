Anyone can host, and everyone should.

I live in New York City, where I run the Pith Supper Club out of my apartment. I’m also a columnist at Food & Wine Magazine, and a voracious traveler most curious about home cooking traditions.

Excellent hospitality does not have to be transactional and hierarchical. There is true joy in becoming a confident and creative host, in your own home, for your own community.
