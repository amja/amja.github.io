For the world premier of a contemporary classical piece composed by Ricardo Romaneiro, Pith created a menu
informed by the music. For the first hour, guests were encouraged to explore the American Irish Historical
Society which had been
[transformed by sound and light installations](http://untappedcities.com/2016/03/02/inside-the-american-irish-historical-society-townhouse-on-fifth-avenue-polytope/).
Upon doing so, they found a number of snack
stations (oysters with champagne gelée, scallops brined in beet juice and coriander seed) as well as two bars
serving cocktails invented for the occasion (white Negronis with Suze and Dolin Blanc, a chamomile/lime/gin
cocktail, and Old Fashioneds with cardamom and orange peel). For each movement of the main musical piece, guests
were given candy suckers to provide a gustatory complement to the sound.

For this event, the food was not presented as hors d'ouvres or a meal, for example blanched ras el hanout carrots
were laid out on a transparent glass table and sprinkled with almonds, harrisa, and baby sorrel. From reviews and
remarks, people appreciated the event's ability to present food as interactive art, complementing a musical
experience as well. The Polytope collaboration has just been confirmed to be reimagined at Art Basel in December
2016.
