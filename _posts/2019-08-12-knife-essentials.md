#### You only need three knives
Until you own a set of good knives, you can't understand the pleasure one feels from effortlessly slicing a plump tomato, cutting lemon wedges, sawing through a crusty loaf of bread, and fileting a fish.

Don't be tempted by giant sets of knives — they will be lackluster, expensive, or both. Instead, create a versatile arsenal of three knives, with three very different purposes.

I get my knives from [Korin](https://www.korin.com/), an amazing importer of Japanese cooking tools based in New York City, but you can find great knives for quick delivery online.

_Paring and Chef's Knife from Tojiro for $90_

### Big Knive
A bigger chefs knife, with a sturdy heftier weight, and a blade equally suited for slicing and chopping. I use my chef's knife 90% of the time in the kitchen. 

I'd reccomend Victorinox for a cheap Western-designed 

And for Japanese blades, which are thinner, lighter, more precise, and require a bit more care — I'd reccomend the easily-avilable Torijo knives, which are well priced and forged from top quality steel.

### Small Knife
Removing seeds from peppers, cutting strawberries, small paring knives allow more complicated knifework, like removing the pith and seeds from a pepper, coring tiny strawberries, or deveining shrimp. If you had to pass on one of these three knives, I'd drop the paring 


### Serrated Knife
Your nice new chef's knife probably can cut through crusty bread or melons, but it will dull its blade quickly as you try to slice through difficult.

Instead, use a serrated toothed blade that you saw back and forth to quickly cut through difficult products like tender tomatoes and crusty sourdough.

_Serrated Knife from Tojiro for $25_

These three — big, small, and serrated — are all any home cook really needs. Investing in sharp ones, keeping them sharp, and using them properly will immensely elevate your home cooking and hosting routines.

#### Keep 'em sharp  
Keep your treasured blades happy by investing in:

### Honing Steel:  
[![](https://images.wisegeek.com/chef-in-white-with-knife.jpg){:.medium}](https://amzn.to/31Q4T3b)  
In daily use, any blade develops tiny tears, bends, and misalignment. Though perhaps visually imperceptable, these kinks create unnecesary friction and misalignment, making a blade feel much less sharp as you slice across its entire length.

A honing steel doesn't sharpen your blade, but rather realigns it. Get in the habit of honing your blade every time they're significantly used — you'll be shocked at how refreshed your knives constantly feel.

### An annual sharpening  
While you can get sharpening stones to truly sharpen the blade every month or so, I would reccomend that most people simply take their knives to a professional sharpener twice a year or so. I have sharpening stones but still choose to pay $20 per knife every year to completely resharpen them. Make sure the sharpener uses high quality Japanese sharpening stones, not a brute force sharpening on a giant industrial machine.

Don't bother sharpening your serrated knives. As long as you're always sawing back and forth and not pressing directly down into super hard things, it will dull very slowly. And serrated knives are always really well priced — after a few years of use you can recycle yours in favor of a replacement.

### A great cutting board

Unless you have a beautiful butcher's block wooden countertop, you need a commercial-grade cutting board that's big enough to really work on and thick enough to steady any knife technique. I always use this black cutting board because it doesn't get discolored with use.  

### Knife Sleeves

Instead of a clunky wooden block taking up countertop space with eighteen things you may or may not use, just place your knives in a convenient drawer, using simple knife sleeves that guard the blade, keep it dry, and protect your fingers.


#### Use them properly
Fancy new tools won't give you good knife skills. Even if , upgrading your knife technique is free and will improve the efficacy of any knives you already have. [Learning To Cook Food](http://www.learningtocookfood.com/knife-skills-gif-guide/) has an amazing collection of GIFs about proper knife technique. I use these same techniques in order to stay safe, efficient, and clean with my cuts.
