Serving good drinks is one of the easiest ways to be a great host. don't need to be an experienced cook to be a great host â€” but having access to the best and most versatile tools ceratinly helps. Below is my essential list of everything I reccomend for people seeking to serve and enjoy beverages as best as possible.

From wine glasses to water glasses, tea bags to coffee pots, bottle openers to sparkling water machines, I've selected only objects that meet my demands in form _and_ function.
