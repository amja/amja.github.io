In mid January, I curated and executed a two-day Pith popup at Lost Property Bar in L.A. The event featured
innovative seasonal snacks as well as a special cocktail menu created by Lost Property’s Jeremy Lake. Guests
enjoyed live music (excellent jazz musicians I selected) while ordering off a menu including snacks like crisped
spätzle with maitake, smoked roe, cured yolk, shallot, and date.
