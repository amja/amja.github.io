Pith curated an evening held at The Bronx Brewery in late February. 114 tickets were sold to the event, which
featured incredible light installations and sound art by NYC artists. Guests were treated to unlimited craft
beer, including two custom casks that I created with the Brewery exclusively for the event. The menu included
celery root soup bittered with hops garnished with tarragon and smoked maple syrup, and a salad of baby mustard
frill with fennel, rhubarb, and grated turmeric.

There was an overwhelming positive reaction, not only from praise of the food throughout the night but also in a
review on

and various Instagram posts and private messages.
