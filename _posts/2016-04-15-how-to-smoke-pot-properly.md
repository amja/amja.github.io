An evening of extravagant cannabis-infused snacking. Live music.
_Oysters and blood cockles with cannabis-champagne gelee. Octopus with ‘smoked’ paprika, black pepper, and olive-hazelnut tapenade. Scallop crudo with nasturtium, charred ramp and cannabis oil, rhubarb, and black salt. Cardamom, salsify, and sour milk ice creams topped with cannabis caramel, cannabis rhubarb compote, and cannabis pistachio merengue._
