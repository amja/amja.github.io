#### You only need three knives
Don't be tempted by giant sets of knives — they will be lackluster, expensive, or both. Instead, create a versatile arsenal of three knives, with three very different purposes.

I get my knives from Korin, an amazing importer of Japanese cooking tools based in New York City, but you can find completely acceptable knives for quick delivery online.


### Small Knife
Removing seeds from peppers, cutting strawberries, 

### Big Knive

### Serrated Knife
Your nice new chef's knife probably can cut through crusty bread or melons, but it will dull its blade quickly as you try to slice through difficult.

Instead, use a serrated toothed blade that you saw back and forth to quickly cut through difficult products like tender tomatoes and crusty sourdough.

#### Keep 'em sharp

In addition to your three knives, invest in a **honing steel** 

And while you can get **sharpening stones** to truly sharpen the blade every month or so, I would reccomend that most people simply take their knives to a professional sharpener twice a year or so. 

Serratted knives are nearly impossible to sharpen, but don't worry. After a few years of use you may want to recycle yours in favor of a replacement.

### Have a cutting board
I use a large, thick professional black cutting board. It keeps the knife sharp, stays steady, and doesn't get discolored with use.

Lastly, store your knives in knife sleeves. You can keep them in a convenient drawer without worrying about the blades chipping against one another, or your hands getting cut accidentally.

#### Use them properly
What would hurt more, gently pressing your thumb into a knife or gently sliding a knife along your thumb? The slicing motion!!

Don't cut by pushing a knife down into something. Instead slide the knife forward and down, pulling the blade into what your cutting. This takes so much less energy and keeps your blade sharp.
