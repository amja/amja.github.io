#### You only need three knives
Don't be tempted by giant sets of knives — they will be lackluster, expensive, or both. Instead, create a versatile arsenal of three knives, with three very different purposes.


### Small Knife
Removing seeds from peppers, cutting strawberries, 

### Big Knive

### Serrated Knife


#### Keep 'em sharp

In addition to your three knives, invest in a **honing steel** 

And while you can get **sharpening stones** to truly sharpen the blade every month or so, I would reccomend that most people simply take their knives to a professional sharpener twice a year or so. 

Serratted knives are nearly impossible to sharpen, and they work very differently. 

Lastly, store your knives in knife sleeves. You can keep them in a convenient drawer without worrying about the blades chipping against one another, or your hands getting cut accidentally.

#### Use them properly



I get my knives from Korin, an amazing importer of Japanese cooking tools based in New York City. 

If you just want to order on Amazon, there's plenty of good options as well.

Recipes will surely vary from one Italian grandmother to the next, but I am loyal to the charming and stoutly _nonna_ who first taught me. _Graffe_ are a perfect performance for breakfast or brunch entertaining: guests love to watch the rings of dough puff up and turn golden, then dunk them into a shallow bowl of granulated sugar  _graffe_ are a a fantastic interactive thing to whip up for friends coming for breakfast or brunch. makes for a really fun and impressively performative brunch or breakfast offering, though I usually eat most of them before guests have a chance.

As always with baking recipes, a scale makes preparing the dough extremely quick. For frying, use a deep but small frying pan with sunflower or grapeseed oil. And have a shallow bowl of granulated white sugar ready for a sublime last minute sweet and crunchy coating that pairs perfeclty 

the barley-sweet donut is sublime  and  a last minute dunk yields a sublime sweet and crunchy exterior.
