I like donuts, but I would never reccomend making them at home — unless they are _graffe_, an insanely delicious Napoletan fried dough derived from what is essentially yeasted gnocchi dough — half mashed potato and half flour. Crazy, but they are impossibly airy and simple, shimmering with granulated sugar and best eaten immediately alongside a foamy cappucino.

A _graffe_ recipe will vary immensely from one Italian grandmother to the next, but I am loyal to the charming and stoutly donut nonna who first taught me.

As always with baking recipes, a scale makes preparing the dough extremely quick. For frying, use a deep but small frying pan with sunflower or grapeseed oil. And have a shallow bowl of granulated white sugar ready — a last-minute coating of crunchy sugar yields a sweet and crunchy exterior that is sublime with the pillowy, practically savory, donut. This makes for a really fun and impressive brunch or breakfast offering, though I usually eat most of them before guests have a chance 😏.

#### Recipe

You can fry using a high-rimmed frying pan filled with sunflower or vegetable oil — Lastly, reserve plenty of granulated sugar in a bowl — as soon as the donuts are finished frying,

> 25 grams sugar
> 250g cup warm water
> 25 grams yeast

> 500 grams flour
> 500 grams potato, boiled until soft and mashed or riced
> 3 eggs

### Preparation

\_Mix first three ingredients in mixing bowl to activate yeast. Then add flour, mashed or riced potatos, and eggs. Mix gently until combined, then rest either for 2 hours on your kitchen counter, or overnight in your refridgertor. Rest the dough in the mixing bowl, covered with a porous towel so the yeast can breath.

### Cooking

\_Set a deep but small frying pan on medium heat with plenty of sunflower or grapeseed oil (canola is fine too) and wait about 10 minutes. If the oil is smoking or turning brown, adjust by turning down the heat or moving pan away from heat completely.

\_Shape dough into loops and fry until golden brown in sunflower or vegetable oil. Dip into shallow bowl of granulated sugar and serve immediately.
