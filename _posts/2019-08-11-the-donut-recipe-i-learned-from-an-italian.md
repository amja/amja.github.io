I like donuts, but I would never reccomend making them at home — unless they are _graffe_, an insanely delicious fried and yeasted potato dough from Naples that's showered with crunchy sugar. I learned this recipe from an Italian grandma whose graffe I ate every day with a cappucino, and it's really worth doing at home. This makes for a really fun and impressive brunch or breakfast offering, though I usually eat most of them before guests have a chance 😏.


### Recipe

_More content goes here_ Hello!

A scale makes assembling the dough much faster. You can fry using a high-rimmed frying pan filled with sunflower or vegetable oil — I set the frying pan on medium heat and wait about 10 minutes. If the oil is smoking or turning brown, it's too hot. Lastly, reserve plenty of granulated sugar in a bowl — as soon as the donuts are finished, you'll want to give them a generous dunk into a bowl of granulated sugar. The crunch and hit of sweetness, followed by the pillowy practically savory donut, is sublime.

> 3 tbsp sugar
1 cup warm water
25 grams yeast

> 500 grams flour 
500 grams potato, boiled until soft
3 eggs

_Mix first three ingredients in mixing bowl to activate yeast. Then add flour, mashed or riced potatos, and eggs. Mix gently and rest overnight. Gently shape dough into loops and fry until golden brown in sunflower or vegetable oil. Sprinkle generously with grnaulated sugar and serve immediately.
