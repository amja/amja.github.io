I like donuts, but I would never reccomend making them at home — unless they are _graffe_, an insanely delicious Napoletan treat made partially from mashed potatoes. It's a surprising and simple recipe, but the result is impossibly airy, shimmering with granulated sugar and best eaten immediately alongside a foamy cappucino.

Recipes will surely vary from one Italian grandmother to the next, but I am loyal to the charming and stoutly _nonna_ who first taught me. _Graffe_ are a perfect performance for breakfast or brunch entertaining: guests love to watch the rings of dough puff up and turn golden, then dunk them into a shallow bowl of granulated sugar  _graffe_ are a a fantastic interactive thing to whip up for friends coming for breakfast or brunch. makes for a really fun and impressively performative brunch or breakfast offering, though I usually eat most of them before guests have a chance.

As always with baking recipes, a scale makes preparing the dough extremely quick. For frying, use a deep but small frying pan with sunflower or grapeseed oil. And have a shallow bowl of granulated white sugar ready for a sublime last minute sweet and crunchy coating that pairs perfeclty 

the barley-sweet donut is sublime  and  a last minute dunk yields a sublime sweet and crunchy exterior.
