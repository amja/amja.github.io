Following the success of Polytope, I will once again collaborate with Ricardo Romaneiro on an exciting
[immersive night](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/metropolis-ensemble-brownstone-360-tickets-24190500438)
at the American Irish Historical Society. The Metropolis Ensemble will transform the mansion, creating a
distinct sound experience in each room. These performances will be linked to a series of small dishes that evoke
the musical textures of the ensemble. As always, I will use seasonal ingredients to challenge the way that guests
think of food.
