A highly experimental performance of contemporary classical music in collaboration with Metropolis Ensemble. Interplay between sound, sight, and taste
across many floors of a society mansion in Manhattan.
_Whipped bone marrow with poppy seed crisp, watermelon radish, fennel. Asparagus and leek with buttermilk, currant, white truffle. Rhubarb and clove with cardamom almond crumble, hopped whipped cream._
