Pith, working with the Metropolis Ensemble, will deliver the gustatory component of a highly experimental
performance of contemporary classical music. Across many floors of a mansion on 5th Avenue, guests will explore the
interplay between sound, sight, and taste.
<em>Unlimited drinks and snacks (including oysters, scallops, morels) by Pith.
