I have been developing a Pith Artist Series whereby I bring in one or two artists (potter, sculptor, fabric
designer) and sell tickets to an event where guests get to take home the pieces they ate out of (interpretations
of cups, plates, silverware, curtains, even tables and chairs). The intention is to invite guests to think about
the overlap between aesthetic visual art and practical dining tools. This artist series is now being planned with
NYCâ€™s smallest art gallery, Front Art Space, tentatively for mid-May.
