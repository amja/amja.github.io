Front Art Space, New York Cityâ€™s tiniest art gallery, sought a provocative and interactive installation. Pith designed a monthlong pop-up in the gallery space, specially commissioning unglazed porcelain ceramics and corresponding bent-metal furniture. During the residency, Jonah intimately cooked and dined with unexpecting pedestrians. Sound artists occasionally joined in to provide a sonic backdrop.
