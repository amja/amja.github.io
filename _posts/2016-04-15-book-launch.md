For the launch of his new book How to Smoke Pot (Properly) David Bienenstock wanted a unique event, and I
organized and executed the culinary aspect of the night. The menu ranged from octopus with smoked paprika, black
pepper, and olive-hazelnut tapenade to an ice-cream bar featuring cardamom, sour cream, and salsify ice-creams
and caramel, rhubarb compote, and brownie toppings. You can read more about this event on
