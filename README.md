## Raw notes from Jonah

basically is there anyway to display that blue and white image against nothing, totally centered on the screen, and then have it fade away after a second into the first yellow image or something very similar to it as a background? with a menu bar up top that has the small blue/white logo in a corner with options like about, upcoming, and contact?

and maybe in the yellow image i sent you, itâ€™s slowly distorting along the three vertical splits in the image (as in the image can be split into three parts along vertically drawn lines that are already in the image, could the image slowly stretch in and out along those thirds?)
