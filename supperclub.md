Pithâ€™s supper club is a weekly convivial dinner in a beautiful Brooklyn townhouse across the Navy Yard. An eclectic group of ten guests sits around a communal table while Jonah cooks and serves an elegant and improvisational meal focusing on seasonal ingredients.  

Dinners begin promptly at 8:00pm, and our address is given after successfully making a reservation. Please expect the meal to last roughly three hours. Because of the small and infrequent nature of the supper club, the menu is subject to change, **allergies or preferences can not be accommodated**, and we pre-sell transferable but **non-refundable** tickets which cost $95 per person with an optional $45 beverage pairing. These prices are all inclusive and gratuities are politely declined. The Pith supper club proudly shares creative input and revenue between all those involved.  

Please click <tito-button event="pith/supper-club"></tito-button> to see available reservations. If there are few open seats, add yourself to the [waitlist](http://eepurl.com/bZ8dIf) or check again soon as new dates are added frequently. We always welcome [inquiries](mailto:inquiries@pith.space) regarding buyouts, events, or offsite parties.
