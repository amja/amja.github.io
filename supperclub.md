Pithâ€™s supper club is a weekly convivial dinner in a beautiful Brooklyn townhouse just across the Manhattan Bridge. An eclectic group of ten guests sits around a communal table while Jonah cooks and serves an elegant and improvisational meal focusing on seasonal ingredients.  

Please expect the meal to last roughly two hours. Because of the small and infrequent nature of the supper club, the menu is subject to change, **substitutions can not be accommodated**, and we pre-sell transferable but **non-refundable** tickets which cost $95 per person. These prices are all inclusive and gratuities are politely declined. The Pith supper club is a proud cooperative with creative input and revenue shared between all those involved.  

Please click <tito-button event="pith/supper-club"></tito-button> to see available reservations. If there are few open seats, add yourself to the [waitlist](http://eepurl.com/bZ8dIf) or check again soon as new dates are added frequently. We always welcome [inquiries](mailto:inquiries@pith.space) regarding buyouts, events, or offsite parties.
