Pith’s supper club is a weekly convivial dinner in a Brooklyn townhouse. Hang out with nine other guests while Jonah cooks and serves an extensive and improvisational meal focusing on seasonal and local ingredients.

Please expect the meal to last roughly two hours. The price of the evening is $90 per person, with an optional beverage pairing. This price is all inclusive and gratuities are politely declined. Because of the small and infrequent nature of the supper club, the menu is subject to change, substitutions can not be accommodated, and we pre-sell transferable but non-refundable tickets. The Pith supper club is a worker-owned cooperative, with profits shared equitably between all those involved.

Unfortunately, at the moment we are unable to accept new reservations. [Join our mailing list](http://eepurl.com/bZ8dIf) or follow on [Instagram](http://instagram.com/pithnyc) to hear about new supper club dates or other Pith events. We always welcome [inquiries](mailto:antonio@pith.space) regarding buyouts, events, or offsite parties.
