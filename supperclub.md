Pithâ€™s supper club is a weekly convivial dinner in a Brooklyn townhouse. Hang out with nine other guests while Jonah cooks and serves an extensive and improvisational meal focusing on seasonal ingredients.

Please expect the meal to last roughly two hours. Because of the small and infrequent nature of the supper club, the menu is subject to change, **substitutions can not be accommodated**, and we pre-sell transferable but **non-refundable** tickets which cost $95 per person or $140 with a beverage pairing. This price is all inclusive and gratuities are politely declined. The Pith supper club is a proud worker-owned cooperative.  

Unfortunately, at the moment we are unable to accept new reservations. [Join our mailing list](http://eepurl.com/bZ8dIf) or follow on [Instagram](http://instagram.com/pithnyc) to hear about new supper club dates or other Pith events. We always welcome [inquiries](mailto:inquiries@pith.space) regarding buyouts, events, or offsite parties.
